## Using Cordova CLI

1. Clone this repo to get the source code for the OpenTok Cordova plugin

2. To install the OpenTok Cordova plugin, run the following command in the root of your project:

```bash
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-opentok
```

3. To remove OpenTok Cordova plugin 3.2.0 and above, use the following command:

```bash
cordova plugin remove cordova-plugin-opentok
```

## Getting Started on your Project:

All your editing will be done in your www folder.

To use the opentok library, make sure you include `opentok.js` file in your HTML document.

```HTML
<script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="opentok.js"></script>
```

All JavaScript code should be written in `onDeviceReady` function in `/js/index.js` because it is executed after all dependencies has loaded.

```js
    onDeviceReady: function() {
        // Do Your Stuff Here!
    }
```
